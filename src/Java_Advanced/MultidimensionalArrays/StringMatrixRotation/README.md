## String Matrix Rotation

### Description
    You are given a sequence of text lines. Assume these text lines form a matrix of characters 
    (pad the missing positions with spaces to build a rectangular matrix). Write a program to rotate the matrix
    by 90, 180, 270, 360,… degrees. Print the result as a sequence of strings at the console after receiving the "END" command.
