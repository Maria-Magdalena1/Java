## Array modifier

### Description

    You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements 
    after receiving the following commands: 
    •	"swap {index1} {index2}" takes two elements and swap their places. 
    •	"multiply {index1} {index2}" takes the element at the 1st index 
    and multiplies it with the element at 2nd index. Save the product at the 1st index. 
    •	"decrease" decreases all elements in the array with 1.

#### Input

    On the first input line, you will be given the initial array values separated by a single space.
    On the next lines, you will receive commands until you receive the command "end".
    The commands are as follows: 
    •	"swap {index1} {index2}" 
    •	"multiply {index1} {index2}" 
    •	"decrease"

#### Output

The output should be printed on the console and consist of elements of the modified array –
separated by a comma and a single space ", ".
