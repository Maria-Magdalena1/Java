## Mixed up Lists

### Description

    Write a program that mixes up two lists by some rules. You will receive two lines of input,
    each one being a list of numbers. The mixing rules are: 
    •	Start from the beginning of the first list and the ending of the second. 
    •	Add element from the first and element from the second.
    •	In the end, there will always be a list in which there are 2 elements remaining. 
    •	These elements will be the range of the elements you need to print. 
    •	Loop through the result list and take only the elements that fulfill the condition.
    •	Print the elements ordered in ascending order and separated by a space
