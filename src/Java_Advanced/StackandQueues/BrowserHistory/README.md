## Browser History

### Description
    Write a program that takes two types of browser instructions: 
    •	Normal navigation: a URL is set, given by a string; 
    •	The string "back" sets the current URL to the last set URL 
    After each instruction, the program should print the current URL. If
    the back instruction can't be executed, print "no previous URLs". 
    The input ends with the "Home" command, and then you simply have 
    to stop the program.
