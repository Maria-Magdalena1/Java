    a chessboard with figures on it. The figures can be - queens as char 'q' or any other ASCII symbol.
    There will be more than one queen, but only one queen will have a valid position, which is not attacked
    by any other queen and does not attack any other queen. In another word, in the way of the valid queen,
    there are no other queens, but there may be any other ASCII symbol. Your task is to read the chessboard
    and find the position of the valid queen. According to chess rules, the queen can attack all the cells 
    in horizontal verticals and both diagonals, which cross the queen position.
