## Change List

### Description

    Write a program that reads a list of integers from the console and receives commands which manipulate the list. 
    Your program may receive the following commands: 
    •	Delete {element} - delete all elements in the array which are equal to the given element 
    •	Insert {element} {position} - insert element at the given position 
    You should stop the program when you receive the command "end". Print all numbers in the array, separated with
    a single whitespace
