    •	Print even – print all the numbers that are even separated by a space 
    •	Print odd – print all the numbers that are oddly separated by a space 
    •	Get sum – print the sum of all the numbers 
    •	Filter {condition} {number} – print all the numbers that fulfill that condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<="
