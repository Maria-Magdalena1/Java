## Applied Arithmetic

### Description
    On the first line, you are given a list of numbers. On the next lines you are passed different 
    commands that you need to apply to all numbers in the list: 
    "add" -> adds 1; 
    "multiply" -> multiplies by 2;
    "subtract" -> subtracts 1;
    "print" -> prints all numbers on a new line. 
    The input will end with an "end" command, after which the result must be printed
