## SoftUni Party

### Description
    There is a party in SoftUni. Many guests are invited, and they are two types: VIP and regular.
    When a guest comes, you have to check if he/she exists on any of the two reservation lists.
    All reservation numbers will be with 8 chars. All VIP numbers start with a digit. 
    There will be 2 command lines: 
    •	First is "PARTY" - the party is on, and guests are coming. 
    •	The second is "END" - then the party is over, and no more guests will come.
    The output shows all guests who didn't come to the party (VIP must be first).
