## Product Shop

### Description
    Write a program that prints information about food shops in Sofia and the products they store. 
    Until the "Revision" command you will receive an input in the format: "{shop}, {product}, {price}".
    Keep in mind that if you get a store that already exists, you must gather product information. 
    Your output must be ordered by shop name and must be in the format: "{shop}-> Product: {product}, Price: {price}"
    The price should be formatted to one digit after the decimal point.
